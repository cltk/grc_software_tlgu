.SH NAME

.B tlgu 
\- convert beta code TLG and PHI CD-ROM txt files to Unicode

.SH SYNOPSIS
.B tlgu
[
.I options
] [
.I input_file
] [
.I output_file
]

.SH DESCRIPTION
.B tlgu
will convert an \fIinput_file\fP from Thesaurus Linguae Graeca (TLG) and Packard Humanities Institute (PHI) representation
to a Unicode (UTF-8) \fIoutput_file\fP.
If \fIinput_file\fP is not specified, standard input will be read.
If \fIoutput_file\fP is not specified, the Unicode text is directed to standard output.
The TLG/PHI representation consists of \fBbeta-code\fP text and \fBcitation\fP information.

.SH OPTIONS
.TP
.B \-b
inserts a form feed and citation information (levels a, b, c, d) on every "book" citation
change.  By default the program will output line feeds only (see also \fB\-p\fP).
.TP
.B \-p
observes paging instructions.  
By default the program will output line feeds only.
.TP
.B \-r
primarily Roman text (PHI). Some TLG texts, notably doccan1.txt and doccan2.txt are mostly
roman texts lacking explicit language change codes.  Setting this option will force
a change to roman text after each citation block is encountered.
.TP
.B \-v
highest-level reference citation is included before each text line (v-level)
.TP
.B \-w
reference citation is included before each text line (w-level)
.TP
.B \-x
reference citation is included before each text line (x-level)
.TP
.B \-y
reference citation is included before each text line (y-level)
.TP
.B \-z
lowest-level reference citation is included before each text line (z-level).
.TP
.B \-Z <custom_citation_format_string>
an arbitrary combination of citation information is included before each text line; 
see also -e option e.g. "%A/%B/%x/%y/%z\\t" will output the contents of the 
A, B \fBcitation description\fP levels, followed by  x, y, z \fBcitation reference\fP levels,
followed by a TAB character.
.TP
.B \-e <custom_blank_citation_string>
if there is no citation information for a citation level defined with the -Z option above, 
a single right-hand slash is substituted by default; you may define any string with this option 
e.g. "-" or "[NONE]" are valid inputs 
.sp 1
.TP
.B \-B
inserts blank space (a tab) before each and every line.
.TP
.B \-X
compact format; v, w, x citations are inserted as they change at the beginning of each section.
.TP
.B \-Y
compact format; w, x, y citations are inserted as they change at the beginning of each section.
.TP
.B \-N
no spaces; line ends and hyphens before an ID code are removed while hyphens and spaces before page 
and column ends are (still) retained.
.sp 1
.TP
.B \-C
citation debug information is output.
.TP
.B \-S
special code debug information is output.
.TP
.B \-V
block processing information is output (verbose).
.TP
.B \-U
vowels with acute accent are output using the Unicode 0x0370 codes rather than the 0x1F00 ones for compatibility with most current (as of 2020) keyboard encoders. 
.TP
.B \-W
each work (book) is output as a separate file in the form output_file-xxx.txt;
if an output file is not specified, this option has no effect.

.SH HISTORY AND INTENDED USE
The purpose of \fBtlgu\fP is to translate binary TLG/PHI-format files into readable and editable text.
It is based on an earlier program written in 80x86 assembly language (1996) outputting codes for
a home-made font which used the prevalent hellenic font encodings of that time complemented
by dead accent characters - not very attractive, but readable.
.sp 1
Then came Unicode and a plethora of accented character glyphs; 
Polytonic fonts are already available (Cardo, Gentium, Athena, Athenian, Porson); new fonts
are being created and older fonts are being expanded as special-use code points are included
in the Unicode definition (musical symbols, other special symbols).
A notable effort since this note was originally drafted is that of the Greek Font Society,
now featuring a great, and expanding, selection of open polytonic fonts.
.sp 1
So, at this point in time, \fBtlgu\fP will crunch a file which has been formatted
according to the published TLG/PHI format and produce codes for most glyphs
generally available.  No attempt has been made to introduce multi-character sequences
or formatting codes (font changes).  If a code has not been defined, the program will output
the respective "code family" glyph.  You may use the \fB\-S\fP option to check such codes
against the published beta code definition.
.sp 1
July 2005 - Troy A. Griffitts (scribe, crosswire org) contributed the arbitrary citation output code and added per-line processing of the input file. 
.sp 1
April 2006 - Final sigma will now be output at end-of-line (!) from free-form input text (thank you Jan).
.sp 1
October 2011 - stdout is used if output_file is not specified.
.sp 1
November 2011 - citations (v, w, x) at the start of section changes (e-book option)
.sp 1
May 2012 -  Nick White (nick white, durham ac uk) revised the input arguments to use tlgu as a filter; stdin is used if input_file is not specified
.sp 1
May 2020 - Alternate output codes for vowels with acute accent (-U option)
.SH EXAMPLES
.B ./tlgu -r DOCCAN2.TXT doccanu.txt
Translate the TLG canon to a unicode text file. Note the use of the \fB-r\fP option (this file
expects Roman as the default font).
.TP
.B ./tlgu -x -y -z TLG1799.TXT tlg1799u.txt
Generate a continuous file with the texts of granpa Euclides. Available citations (-x -y -z)
are Book//demonstratio/line as shown in the respective "cit" field of doccan2.txt.
.TP
.B ./tlgu -b -B TLG1799.TXT tlg1799u.txt
Generate the same texts, this time with a page feed and book citation information on the first
page of each book and a tab before each line (use with OOo versions earlier than 1.1.4).
.TP
.B ./tlgu -C TLG1799.TXT tlg1799u.txt
See how the citation information changes within each TLG block.
.TP
.B ./tlgu -S TLG1799.TXT tlg1799u.txt | sort > symbols1799.txt
Check out the symbols used in a work.  Book and x, y, z references are printed on a separate
line for each symbol. Sort / grep the output to locate specific symbols of interest; save in
a file for later use.
.TP
.B ./tlgu -W TLG0006.TXT tlg0006u
Will produce separate files for each work, named tlg006u-001.txt etc.
.TP
.B ./tlgu -Z \N'34'%A/%B/%D/%c/%d/%Z/%x/%y/%z\et\N'34' -e \N'34'-\N'34' chr0010.txt chr0010u.txt
Will generate a file with citation description (A, B, D, Z) and citation reference (c, d, x, y, z)
levels, separated by "/" followed by a TAB character and the respective text.  
Blank citation elements will be filled with a single "-" 
e.g. Asia/Smyrna/1222-1223 ac/IGChAs/Asia Min [Chr]/88/-/2A/7p1 [TAB] inscription text etc.
.TP
.B ./tlgu -r -N -X LAT0448.TXT LAT0448.xx.TXT
will produce a compact version of the Gaius Iulius Caesar texts with v and x citations printed 
as they change; similarly,
.B ./tlgu -r -N -Y LAT2150.TXT LAT2150.yy.TXT
will produce a compact version of Zeno's texts.
.SH POST-PROCESSING EXAMPLES
I use the OpenOffice/LibreOffice suite for most of my work.  This example shows one of many possible
ways of using the search and replace facility to create a readable version of the Suda lexicon.
.TP
.B ./tlgu -B TLG4085.TXT tlg4085u.txt
A Unicode file with the text is created
.TP
.B Open the generated file with Openoffice/LibreOffice:
File | Open | Filename: tlg4085u.txt,
File Type: Text Encoded \-\- Press Open
.sp 1
The ASCII Filter Options window appears. Select the Unicode (UTF-8) character set and
a proper Unicode font installed in your machine (e.g. Cardo).  Press OK.
.TP
.B Replace angle brackets with expanded text
Lexicon terms are enclosed in <angle brackets>.  The actual beta codes indicate the use of
expanded text for emphasis.  Select Edit | Find & Replace.  The \fBFind & Replace\fP window appears.
.sp 1
In the \fBSearch For\fP field, type the following expression: \fB<[^<>]*>\fP
This means "find any characters between angle brackets, not including angle brackets".
.sp 1
In the \fBReplace With\fP window insert a single ampersand: \fB&\fP
This means that we need to \fBadd\fP formatting information (this case) or additional text to
the text found.  Press  \fBMore Options\fP, \fBFormat...\fP and select the \fBPosition\fP tab; select Spacing 
Expanded by 2.0 points.  Press OK.
.sp 1
Check the \fBRegular Expressions\fP box and press \fBReplace All\fP.
.sp 1
You may now replace the angle brackets with nothings.
.sp 1
Repeat the above procedure for titles enclosed in {braces}.  Write a macro...
.TP
.B Other useful information
If you are using your wordprocessor with a locale setting other than Hellenic (el_GR), the following
invocation with the desired character classification may prove useful for the occasional polytonic editing:
.br
.sp 1
\fBLC_CTYPE=el_GR.UTF-8 /usr/bin/soffice\fP (or \fB/opt/libreoffice3.4/program/soffice\fP ).
.br
.sp 1
I put my default locale and keyboard definitions in my \fB.bashrc\fP or \fB.profile\fP: 
.br
.sp 1
.na
.B export LC_CTYPE=el_GR.UTF-8
.br
.na
.B setxkbmap us,el ,polytonic -option grp:ctrl_shift_toggle -option grp_led:scroll
.br
.sp 1
This way multi-lingual text can be entered;  keyboard layout switching is done by pressing Ctrl/Shift;
alternate keyboard layout is indicated by the Scroll Lock light on the keyboard.

.SH FURTHER DEVELOPMENT
You may not like the character output for a specific code.  Check out the \fBtlgcodes.h\fP file
containing the special symbol and punctuation codes and select one to suit you better.  It will
probably be a while before the beta to Unicode correspondence settles down.
.sp 1
Drop me a line, if you need a new feature; let me know if you do find
an interesting applications that others can profit from.
